```
gradle katalonCopyDependencies
```

### Updating the Katalon profile
Set following values of the adaklabs profile to new ones using info from your own profile on adaklabs server.
```
RP_HOST : your adaklabs API host. Ex : http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/v1

```groovy
@SetUp(skipped = false) // Please change skipped to be false to activate this method.
def setUp() {
	// Put your code here.
	ExecutionEventManager.getInstance().addListenerEventHandle(new ReportPortalListener("Sample_Launch", "Sample_Suite"))
}
```
